<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Game testers provide quality assurance (QA) for the companies that produce video games.
 They make sure games function correctly, and that instructions and documentation are clear. They identify problems and bugs, and report their findings to designers and developers.
  This is important to video game companies as they need feedback from others to fix anything that needs to be fixed. This can be more beneficial than letting out a beta or alpha for the general public to see.
  The reason for this is that they might release an insanely unplayable game that might put a bad reputaion on the game developers. Due to the reputation, this might be the donfall of a game despite them stating its not finished.</p>
<br>
<p>Game testers to the video game dsign industry a huge favor so there aren't other experiences like the game E.T that came out in 1982.
 This game brought upon the idea of quality assurance to others which made sure people weren't wasting their money and getting a bad product.
  One of the first companies to ensure this is Nintendo. They had their own official seal put on games that were tested for quality.</p>
<h2>Education Needed</h2>
<p>The most important training required to be a video game tester takes place not in a classroom, but on your own leisure time; you must be experienced, knowledgeable and well-versed in video game playing. Because testing a given game requires you to beat each level and defeat every villain, you must be a skilled game player with solid hand-eye coordination. According to industry information published by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), you'll also need computer knowledge and strong communication skills to compose and submit game reports on company databases (www.bls.gov).
The BLS notes that a college education isn't required to work as a video game tester, but some employers may prefer testers with certificates in computer science.
 Numerous colleges offer certificates and associate's degrees in information technology, database management or related areas. These programs cover basic computer skills like database queries and management, software applications, multimedia and web development.</p>
