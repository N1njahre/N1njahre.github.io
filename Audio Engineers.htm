<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>An audio engineer works with the sounds within the game. They can set the tone for an area or even the whole game with music alone. They don't don't only do music though.
Audio engineers produce the musc, sound effects, voices, and ambient.If the setting was in a forrest, they'd work with sounds that fit like birds chirping or bushes and leaves rustling. The same could be said abou the voice acting.
 They make sure the voices aren't distorted or muffled so the players can clearly hear the actors.</p>
<br>
<p>Without audio engineers, there would be no ambience for any games and not only that, the music and voice acting would be next to none or really bad.
 The voices would sound like they were talking in the actual studio instead of in the game. It would ruin the immersion that gamers love so much.</p>
<h2>Education Needed</h2>
<p>Aspiring sound designers can develop the necessary skills and experience by earning a postsecondary non-degree award or certificate. However education options range from 1-year diploma programs to bachelor's and master's degrees in sound design. Art schools, film schools and universities offer programs in the industry. Good schools provide up-to-date training in well-equipped sound studios.
Students take courses in sound mixing, sound editing and recording techniques. They learn about Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI), as well as how to use Pro Tools, Final Cut Pro and other industry-related software.
 Programs that focus on theatrical sound design may also require introductory classes in set, costume and lighting design.</p>
