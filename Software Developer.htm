<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Software developers design software that makes video games work the way the designers want them to. Software developers are, in a way, like computer programmers. They deal with the logical aspects and the software used to play the game.
They ensure that the game is functional to actually play. No software developer means no game becuase there's no possoble play to get it to function anywhere. You can't play the game if it's incompatible with the sysytem it's on.</p>
<br>
<p>Software developers are very imporant for the sake of having others being able to play the games. There would be no need for gaming PCs or even a game console if there were no possible way to get it to play on those systems.
Not evertyhing about game design has to be about the looks of the game. It also involves the functionality of it.</p>
<h2>Education Needed</h2>
<p>Most employers ask you to have a bachelor's degree in something like computer science, software engineering, mathematics, physics, electrical engineering or computer information systems. However, depending on the job, you may only need a 2-year associate's degree.
 One the other side, more complicated work will require a master's or even a doctoral degree.</p>
