<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Interpreters convert characters' dialogue into other languages.
 Translators change instructions and other documentation from their original languages to others.
  Their work is what allows companies to market games to an international market.
   Video games would not be as heavily funded as they are today if it weren't for interpreters and translators because people from other countries would not be able to play them properly.
   Communities of the game could potentially do the translating themselves but it would take lots of time and dedication.</p>
<br>
<p>Interpreters and translators have a special role and a unique one since other postions deal with the look and the functionality of the game as these two roles deal with language.
 Games like Mario, Metroid, and Legend of Zelda would not be playable here as these games are made by a foreign gaming company.</p>
<h2>Education Needed</h2>
<p>A bachelor's degree is typically needed to become an interpreter or translator along with proficiency in at least two languages, one of which is usually English.
High school students interested in becoming an interpreter or translator should take a broad range of courses that focus on foreign languages and English writing and comprehension.
Beyond high school, people interested in becoming interpreters or translators have numerous educational options. Those in college typically choose a specific language as their major, such as Spanish or French.
 Although many jobs require a bachelor's degree, majoring in a language is not always necessary.</p>
