<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>A computer programmer, also known as coders, codes the games so the computer can follow the instructions which involves more of a logical understanding more than an artistic one. Coders make the game work the way it was intended to.
 They allow control to the player so they can do the thngs that most games have like the ability to move in different direction, jump up, look around, and interact with the enviroment around them.
  However, they do much more than just worry about the commands which is why they have multiple people that are segmented to do different tasks. They make the psychics of the game.
   This includes things like how fast the player falls or how a car accelerations, or even how fast a bullet travels</p>
<br>
<p>Although it takes multiple roles to make a game. A company that creates games that don't have a computer programer is a company that won't have an game.
It's one thing to create the look of the game and make it look phenomenal but if there's no code so any one can play the game.
 It will basically be a screensaver because there needs to be code to enable animations of any sort or for a menu to work. No code equals no game.</p>
<h2>Education Needed</h2>
<p>Many game development companies prefer to hire programmers who have at least a bachelor's degree. Several degree programs might prepare you for the field, including those more general programs in computer programming and mathematics. However some schools do offer specialized degree programs, such as a Bachelor of Science in Game Programming.
A 4-year degree program in game programming teaches you how to design, program and test new software. Such programs often require you to create your own video game program before graduation. Some specific courses covered include visual design, programming, game development, computer graphics and game modification.
 A bachelor's degree program in software engineering will also provide you with the basic building blocks necessary to work in the video game programming field.</p>
