<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>An animator gives life to games by demonstrating various levels of movement depending on the subject. Without them, everything would be stiff and stationary.
They portray behaviors for charcters and design how the charcter will walk, jump, or even just stand there idly.</p>
<br>
<p>It's not the only for the charcters though. They portray how the scenery acts like.
 A few examples would be how grass moves in certain areas, how the stars twinkle, or even how the weather acts.
 They may not make up up for the design for whetver they may animate but they do determine it's movement and personality.</p>
<h2>Education Needed</h2>
<p>The first step to becoming a video game animator is to get your associate's or bachelor's degree. Associate's degree options are an Associate of Science in Video Game Design and Associate of Arts in Computer Arts Animation. A 2-year associate's degree is the minimum degree requirement for most jobs in the game design industry, but your job prospects will improve with the completion of a bachelor's degree program.

Bachelor's degree programs generally take four years to complete, although there are some accelerated programs that can be completed in about three years.
 Some of the most common degrees programs are a Bachelor of Science in Animation and Game Development and Bachelor of Science in Animation.</p>
